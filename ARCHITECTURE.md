# Architecture

Better Micro APO is a capture APO built on `CBaseAudioProcessingObject`. COM
identity and aggregation are handled by ATL (`CComObjectRootEx`, `CComCoClass`,
`CComAggObject`), the same structure Microsoft's SwapAPO sample uses.

## Interfaces

- `IAudioProcessingObject`
- `IAudioProcessingObjectConfiguration`
- `IAudioProcessingObjectRT`
- `IAudioSystemEffects`

## Processing

- 1 input / 1 output, in-place, zero latency.
- Supported sample formats: float32, PCM16, PCM24, PCM32 (container size must
  equal the valid-bit size).
- The compressor uses a linked peak detector across channels, so a stereo
  source keeps its image.
- Optional mono mode copies the processed left channel to every other channel,
  for a mono source connected to input 1 of a stereo interface.

## Per-device settings

One DLL serves every capture device. Each APO instance identifies its endpoint
from `APOInitSystemEffects2` in `Initialize`: the last item in
`pDeviceCollection` is the endpoint `IMMDevice`, and the last `{GUID}` in
`IMMDevice::GetId()` is the key used under
`HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\MMDevices\Audio\Capture`.

`LockForProcess` reads
`C:\ProgramData\better_micro_apo\devices\{endpoint-guid}.ini`, clamps the
values, and precomputes the DSP coefficients. `APOProcess` only uses the
cached instance state, so the real-time path does no file I/O and no
allocation. Missing files fall back to the defaults.

The GUI writes the same files during `Apply`, inside the existing audio-stop
section, then restarts the audio service once.

## Registration and logging

- CLSID: `{6A8BE200-CD89-4E77-97F5-D51E8F16EF90}`
- Logs setup calls to `C:\ProgramData\better_micro_apo\better_micro_apo.log`
  and to `OutputDebugStringW`. `APOProcess` never logs or allocates.

## Packaging

The build embeds the APO DLL in `better_micro_apo_gui.exe` as an `RCDATA`
resource (`IDR_APO_DLL`), so the GUI is the only file that needs to be
distributed. CMake stages the built DLL at
`build/apo_embed/better_micro_apo.dll`, generates the resource script from
`gui/apo_dll.rc.in`, and touches it after every DLL build so the resource
compiler picks up the new bytes. `Install` extracts the resource to
`C:\Program Files\better_micro_apo\better_micro_apo.dll` and registers it.
